        Hi! I'm <span class="font-bold">Flora Hommand</span>, a frontend developer based in
        <span class="italic">Marseille, France</span>. I specialize in
        <span class="font-semibold">Vue.js</span> and <span class="font-semibold">TypeScript</span>,
        but Iâ€™m always eager to explore and learn new technologies.

        <br /><br />
        Originally a visual artist, I discovered programming by creating generative artworks. Since
        then, I have been fascinated by the innovative and creative potential of coding, and I bring
        that creativity into every project I work on.

        <br /><br />
        I thrive in collaborative environments and love contributing as a true team player. I enjoy
        iterating quickly, turning ideas into working solutions fast while keeping a focus on
        quality and usability.

        <br /><br />
